## Restaurant_reviews

It's Friday night, you're confused which restaurant should you go to for dinner. You decided to check the reviews for all the nearby restaurants on Yelp and then choose the recommended one. 

Let's assume that Yelp collected all reviews from several new restaurants and it hired us, as Data sciecntist, to help the company analysing the reviews and affect a rating to each restaurant based on customer's experiences.

Our goal is to build a model that is able to predict whether a review is positif or negatif. 
In this notebook, we are going to explore all the reviews and implement a machine learning algorithm that predicts custumer's sentiment from his review.


##### Predictive model

Create a bag of words from the reviews and train a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the sentiment feeled by the reviewer about the restaurant.

###### Results

Accuracy: 0.73
